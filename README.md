#  Commodities Forecasting with Neural Networks

This repository contains the full implementation of my Master's thesis:  
**"Forecasting Commodity Markets Using Neural Networks: A Quantitative Study Using Engineered Inputs and Deep Learning Architectures."**

The project explores the use of deep learning architectures—including LSTM, GRU, Transformer-based models, and hybrid variants—for **1-day ahead forecasting** of major commodities: **Gold**, **Silver**, and **Copper**.
